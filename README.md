**Frank Hartung's Application on Web**

</div>

Hey! 👋

This is AppliWeb, my Application on Web. It is my personal project to show off my web development skills. If you are looking for a **highly motivated** and **energetic** web developer, feel free to contact me via [XING](xing.com/).

## 🚀 Used technologies

Of course I didn't code everything on my own. AppliWeb relies on many *Open-Source libraries* hacked by many *awesome developers*. My greatest thanks to you! 🙏

On it's core, this project was bootstrapped with [*Create-React-App*](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)/[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) by Facebook.
The UI is build on [*Material-UI*](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), that provides powerful React components based on *Google*s **Material Design**.

Therefore, the used programming languages are mainly **HTML**, **CSS** and **TypeScript**.

### 🤓 Some more buzzwords

AppliWeb supports 📱 **responsive design** up to mobile devices and is ♿ **accessible** for mostly everyone.
It is available in two languages, 🇺🇸 english and 🇩🇪 german. Plus it supports a ☀️ light and a 🌙 dark theme.

### 📚 Used Libraries

Here a more comprehensive list of the used libraries:

*Libraries used in production:*
| Library   | Use Case  |
| --------- | --------- |
| [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) | UI Framework providing React components based on *Material Design*, plus icons. |

## 🔨 Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
